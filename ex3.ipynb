    "Predict the SP500 with the â€€nancial indicators assigned to your team in the google spreadsheet (ep, dp, de, dy, dfy, bm, svar, ntis, in, tbl , see RLab3 2 GWcausalSP500.R), some lagged series of these indicators and lags of the target using a Neural Network and a GP regression with your desired kernel. Predict return, or price, or direction (up or down). For which target works best? Do some feature selection to disregard some variables, select appropriate lags: causality, (distance) correlation, VAR-test, Lasso ... (The script RLab5 GausProc.R can be of help. The dataset is goyal-welch2022Monthly.csv and work within the period 1927/2021.)"
